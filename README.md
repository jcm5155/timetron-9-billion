 ### Make timed “splits” for your life.
  Create custom countdown timer “segments” that can be chained together into "routines” which allow for the precise tracking of larger lengths of time. 
  Run a time routine in the background and let it keep you on track while you study, practice your musical instrument, run your next meeting etc.

  The tech.

  Notes.
  ----
  This is my first time using any of these technologies/frameworks. I tried my best, but if you see anything 
  glaringly ignorant (especially regarding the application's structure/organization) and if you have the time or desire, please let me know how I can be better!

###### This is my final project for my time in LaunchCode's Immersive CodeCamp (Oct. 2019 - Jan 2020). The curriculum for this course covered Python(+Flask), MySQL, and C#(+.NET Core). I started learning Javascript, React+Redux, and Django on my own time over the course of ~1-2 weeks in late January 2020 (and loved every minute of it).
